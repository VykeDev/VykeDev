**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Student)`**

Hi, I'm Vyke, a self-taught engineer with a passion for technology. I wrote my first line of code when I was 14, but I only really started getting serious about it two years ago. I believe technology is the future and has the highest potential to improve lives globally.
